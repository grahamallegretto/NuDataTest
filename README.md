# NuData Test - Graham Allegretto
Answers for each question can be found in respective folder

### Question 1:
* Contains _question1.py_ which includes implementation and tests
* I wrote it in python, hope that's okay

### Question 2:
* Contains _numsort.sh_ and a test for it called _question2Test.sh_. 
* I didn't test it with 50 billion numbers but it should work

### Question 3:
* I put everything in _retry.js_. 
* Tested it individually and included tests for simple retry, jitter, and exponential backoff.
* Tests may come out a little mangled because I didn't wait for one test to finish before the next one is kicked off

### Question 4:
* Partially completed. Didn't have time to put into jars and implement dependency injection using them (This was my first time using maven/dependency injection and it's been a long time since I've used java)
* Can run test of what I have by "mvn test"

### Question 5:
* Contains _openapi.json_
* To be honest, I essentially copied what swagger had as an example and used it to create a API spec for a rollerblade sharing company

Thanks!
